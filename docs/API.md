# crosspoint-sync API

The contract for firmware (CrossPoint / CrossInk) and any other client. Two API surfaces share one
account system and the same auth headers:

1. **KOSync-compatible API** at the root — byte-compatible with `sync.koreader.rocks`. Stock
   KOReader and current CrossPoint firmware work by changing only the server URL.
2. **Extended API** under `/api/v1` — lossless CrossPoint positions, bookmarks, clippings,
   reading stats, and document metadata.

All requests and responses are JSON (`Content-Type: application/json`). The
`Accept: application/vnd.koreader.v1+json` header is accepted but never required.

## Authentication

Every endpoint except `POST /users/create` and `GET /healthz` requires:

```
x-auth-user: <username>
x-auth-key:  <MD5 hex of the account password>
```

The key is the lowercase 32-hex MD5 of the plain password — exactly what KOReader and CrossPoint
already send. The server never sees the plain password and stores only a salted PBKDF2 of the key.

### Error responses

Errors reuse the stock kosync codes so existing client error handling keeps working:

| HTTP | code | Meaning |
|------|------|---------|
| 401  | 2001 | Missing/invalid auth headers |
| 402  | 2002 | Username already registered |
| 403  | 2003 | Invalid request body / registration disabled |
| 403  | 2004 | Missing or malformed `document` |
| 429  | 2001 | Rate limited (registration / repeated auth failures) |

Body shape is always `{"code": 2001, "message": "Unauthorized"}`.

## Document identity

`document` is an opaque key chosen by the client, up to 64 chars of `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`. CrossPoint
sends the KOReader 32-hex MD5 (partial-binary or filename method, per device setting). The server
never tries to unify the two hash methods; a book synced under both appears as two documents.
A client that knows two keys name one book can say so per request — see
[multi-identifier matching](#multi-identifier-document-matching-optional).

## KOSync-compatible API

### POST /users/create

Open registration (disable with `REGISTRATION_DISABLED=true`).

```json
// request
{"username": "justin", "password": "0f359740bd1cda994f8b55330c86d845"}
// 201 response
{"username": "justin"}
```

Usernames: 1–64 chars of `[A-Za-z0-9._@+-]`. The `password` field is the MD5 auth key.

### GET /users/auth

Validates credentials. `200 {"authorized": "OK"}` or `401`.

### PUT /syncs/progress

```json
// request
{
  "document": "a1b2c3d4e5f60718293a4b5c6d7e8f90",
  "progress": "/body/DocFragment[8]/body/div[2]/p[4]/text()[1].96",
  "percentage": 0.4867,
  "device": "CrossPoint",
  "device_id": "crossink-device"
}
// 200 response
{"document": "a1b2c3d4e5f60718293a4b5c6d7e8f90", "timestamp": 1752345678}
```

- One row is stored per `(user, document, device_id)` — unlike stock kosync, devices never
  overwrite each other. If `device_id` is absent, `device` is used as the device key.
- `percentage` is a float in `[0, 1]`. `timestamp` is unix **seconds** (integer).
- **Superset capture:** the body may include the extended `position` object (see
  `PUT /api/v1/progress`) and/or a `metadata` object (below). If present and valid they are
  stored; unknown fields are ignored. This lets firmware ship rich sync against this endpoint
  with a one-line change.
- **Metadata capture** (KOReader PR #15306 shape, sent by CrossPoint when the "send metadata"
  setting is on):

  ```json
  "metadata": {
    "filename": "Foundryside - Robert Jackson Bennett.epub",
    "title": "Foundryside",
    "authors": "Robert Jackson Bennett",
    "bookfusion_id": "36835"
  }
  ```

  All fields optional strings (≤512 chars). `filename`/`title`/`authors` are stored per
  `(user, document)`; fields the client omits never overwrite previously stored values. Retrieve
  via `GET /api/v1/documents` or joined into `GET /api/v1/progress`.

  **Service ids.** Any extra `<service>_id` field (from a CrossPoint plugin's book sidecar,
  e.g. `bookfusion_id`) pre-seeds an exact match for the connector of that name: progress is
  pushed straight to that record, skipping title/author search. Unknown-connector ids are
  ignored; a user's manual match is never overridden.

  **BookFusion positions.** For a BookFusion download identified by its sidecar, the server
  retrieves the EPUB and resolves the existing KOSync XPath against its chapter XHTML.
  It sends the resulting CFI, chapter index, and text-based spine-normalized position to
  BookFusion. This requires no additional firmware fields. Precision follows the supplied
  XPath: a text-node offset identifies that text position; a paragraph/chapter-only XPath
  identifies its start. An unresolved XPath fails without posting an estimated position.

  When a device requests `GET /syncs/progress/:document` or
  `GET /api/v1/progress/:document`, the server first fetches the matched BookFusion
  book's latest position, resolves its point CFI in the EPUB, and then reads the stored
  progress for the response. This requires a linked, enabled account and a previously
  received sidecar match; a GET cannot discover metadata that the device has not sent.
  BookFusion is not polled in the background. Concurrent requests for the same user's
  book share a lookup; subsequent requests check the provider again.

  Refreshes have a 10-second total deadline. A timeout returns HTTP 504; provider or
  conversion failures return HTTP 502. Stored progress is preserved and the next GET
  retries the refresh. Books without an enabled sidecar match use the normal KOSync
  response. No firmware update is needed. Conversion uses the provider's update
  timestamp, skips older positions, and preserves text offsets (converting UTF-16 CFI
  offsets to CrossPoint codepoints). Delayed outbound
  events also check the remote timestamp before posting, to avoid replacing newer
  BookFusion progress. The provider does not offer an atomic conditional update, so a
  simultaneous edit between that check and the POST is still possible.

  The server reuses downloaded archives for 15 minutes in an account-scoped memory cache
  capped at 32 MiB total and 32 entries. Downloads are limited to 32 MiB and 30 seconds;
  each extracted XML file is limited to 1 MiB. Only the package metadata and target chapter
  are decompressed. Books matched by title or manual selection retain percentage-only
  outbound updates and are excluded from inbound position conversion because those matches do not establish that the reader has the same EPUB edition.

### GET /syncs/progress/{document}

Returns the newest progress **across all of the user's devices** (most recent `timestamp` wins):

```json
{
  "document": "a1b2c3d4e5f60718293a4b5c6d7e8f90",
  "progress": "/body/DocFragment[8]/body/div[2]/p[4]/text()[1].96",
  "percentage": 0.4867,
  "device": "CrossPoint",
  "device_id": "crossink-device",
  "timestamp": 1752345678
}
```

**Quirk (stock-compatible):** if no progress exists, the response is `200` with `{}` — not 404.
KOReader clients check for field presence, not status codes.

### Multi-identifier document matching (optional)

Tracks [koreader/koreader-sync-server#55](https://github.com/koreader/koreader-sync-server/pull/55),
which is open and unmerged. A reader who recompresses an EPUB, re-downloads it from another shop or
converts it gets a different `document` and loses the position, even though it is the same book. A
client that can compute several digests for one file offers them all, strongest first, and the
server matches on the first one it recognises.

```jsonc
// PUT /syncs/progress
{
  "document": "<content digest>",
  "identifiers": [
    {"type": "content",   "value": "<content digest>"},
    {"type": "structure", "value": "<structure digest>"},
    {"type": "metadata",  "value": "<metadata digest>"}
  ],
  "progress": "/body/DocFragment[20]/body/p[22]", "percentage": 0.32, "device": "kpw"
}
// 200 response
{"document": "<canonical digest>", "match": "content", "timestamp": 1752345678}
```

```
GET /syncs/progress/<content digest>?ids=content:<c>,structure:<s>,metadata:<m>
```

```json
{"document": "<canonical digest>", "progress": "…", "percentage": 0.32,
 "device": "kpw", "device_id": "kpw", "timestamp": 1752345678,
 "match": "structure", "progress_match": "metadata"}
```

- `type` is an opaque label chosen by the client: the server stores and echoes it without
  interpreting it, so a new kind of identifier needs no server change.
- `document` in the response is the **canonical** key the record is stored under, which is not
  necessarily the one the request sent. Address that one on the next request.
- `match` is the type that **found** the record. `progress_match` is the strongest identifier the
  caller shares with whoever **wrote the current `progress` string**, or `"none"`. They answer
  different questions: a reader can match a record on its own content digest and still be reading a
  different edition from the one that wrote the position, in which case the xpointer does not apply.
  Only `progress_match` bears on whether the position can be followed.
- The **first entry's `value` must equal `document`**, so `document` keeps meaning "the identifier I
  would send if you only took one". At most 8 entries, no repeated `type`, `type` matching
  `[a-z][a-z0-9-]*` (≤32 chars), `value` matching `[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]*` (≤128 chars).
  Anything else is `403` with code `2003`, including a malformed `ids`.
- Identifiers other than the record's own become **aliases** for it, per account. An alias is
  created and never repointed, and never shadows a digest that is a document in its own right.
- **A request that names no identifiers is answered exactly as it always was**: no `match`, no
  `progress_match`, and the read follows no alias. Aliases belong to callers who opt in. Manual
  merges (`POST /api/v1/documents/merge`) are separate and still apply to every request.

---

## Extended API (/api/v1)

Same auth headers. Designed for the ESP32: responses are small (< 8 KB at default limits), keys are
short, batches are capped.

### Delta-sync protocol (bookmarks & clippings)

- `GET ...?since=<unix>&limit=<n>` returns items with `updated_at > since`, oldest first, including
  **tombstones** (`"deleted": 1`). `limit` defaults to 50, max 100.
- The response carries `until` (persist it as the next `since` cursor) and `more` (repeat with
  `since = until` until `more` is false).
- `PUT` batches set `updated_at` on the **server clock** — the server is the last-write-wins
  authority because device RTCs drift. A delete is `{"id": "...", "deleted": 1}` (no other fields
  needed). Deleted items keep tombstones forever so late-syncing devices converge.
- Merge semantics: set-union of ids, last-write-wins per id.

### Rich progress

#### PUT /api/v1/progress

The kosync body plus a `position` object mapping 1:1 to the firmware's `CompactPosition`:

```json
{
  "document": "a1b2c3d4e5f60718293a4b5c6d7e8f90",
  "progress": "/body/DocFragment[8]/body/div[2]/p[4]/text()[1].96",
  "percentage": 0.4867,
  "device": "CrossPoint",
  "device_id": "A1B2C3D4",
  "position": {
    "pctQ": 486700,
    "spine": 7,
    "page": 143,
    "pages": 412,
    "para": 96,
    "li": 0,
    "anchor": "ch08-sec2",
    "xpath": "/body/DocFragment[8]/body/div[2]/p[4]/text()[1].96"
  }
}
```

| field  | type | notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| pctQ   | uint | percentage × 1,000,000 (0–1,000,000). Layout-independent; authoritative. |
| spine  | uint16 | spine (chapter) index |
| page / pages | uint16 | page within spine / spine page count — **layout hints**, depend on font settings |
| para   | uint16, optional | synthetic 1-based paragraph index; omit when unavailable (`hasParagraphIndex=false`) |
| li     | uint16, optional | running `<li>` count; omit when unavailable |
| anchor | string ≤ 48 bytes, optional | nearest `<a id>` anchor |
| xpath  | string ≤ 120 bytes, optional | KOReader-style xpath |

Response: `{"document": "...", "timestamp": 1752345678}`.

An invalid `position` is ignored (the kosync fields still sync); a missing `position` on a later
PUT keeps the previously stored one for that device.

#### GET /api/v1/progress

Lists every synced document — newest progress across devices, joined with any stored metadata.
This is how clients/UIs discover documents without knowing hashes. `?limit=` defaults to 100
(max 500), ordered newest-first.

```json
{
  "items": [
    {"document": "25f8abb4f4f5594f02f361726814fea1",
     "title": "Foundryside", "author": "Robert Jackson Bennett",
     "filename": "Foundryside - Robert Jackson Bennett.epub",
     "percentage": 0.2853, "progress": "/body/DocFragment[16]/body/div[1]/p[143]",
     "device_id": "crosspoint-reader", "device": "CrossPoint", "timestamp": 1783913361}
  ]
}
```

`title`/`author`/`filename` are `null` until some client sends metadata for that document.

#### GET /api/v1/progress/{document}

All device rows, newest first — the client decides what to apply:

```json
{
  "document": "a1b2c3d4e5f60718293a4b5c6d7e8f90",
  "devices": [
    {"device_id": "A1B2C3D4", "device": "CrossPoint", "percentage": 0.4867,
     "progress": "...", "position": { "pctQ": 486700, "spine": 7, "page": 143, "pages": 412 },
     "timestamp": 1752345678},
    {"device_id": "koreader-boox", "device": "boox", "percentage": 0.41,
     "progress": "...", "position": null, "timestamp": 1752300000}
  ]
}
```

`position` is `null` for rows written by plain kosync clients.

#### DELETE /api/v1/progress/{document}

Removes a synced book completely. Deletes the kosync progress for **every** device plus everything
else stored server-side for that book: position samples, bookmarks, clippings, per-book reading
stats, connector matches and any queued connector events. Document metadata goes too, so the book
disappears from `GET /api/v1/progress` and `GET /api/v1/documents`, and `GET
/syncs/progress/{document}` goes back to returning `{}`.

```json
{"document": "a1b2c3d4e5f60718293a4b5c6d7e8f90", "deleted": true, "rows": 14}
```

`rows` is the number of database rows removed. Returns `404 {"code": 2003, "message": "Unknown
document"}` when the user has no data for that document.

Bookmarks and clippings are hard-deleted rather than tombstoned — there is no book left to
delta-sync against. A device that still holds the file simply re-uploads its state on the next
sync, so this is a server-side reset, not a device-side delete.

### Bookmarks

Item ids are **client-derived**: `id = first 16 hex chars of SHA-256(xpath)`. Deterministic, so
re-adding the same bookmark is idempotent and delete-by-id needs no new device-side state. All
CrossPoint devices must compute ids identically.

#### GET /api/v1/bookmarks/{document}?since=&limit=

```json
{
  "document": "a1b2c3d4e5f60718293a4b5c6d7e8f90",
  "until": 1752345678,
  "more": false,
  "items": [
    {"id": "9f86d081884c7d65",
     "xpath": "/body/DocFragment[3]/body/p[12]/text().0",
     "percentage": 0.35,
     "summary": "It was the best of times, it was the worst of",
     "si": 3, "pc": 120, "pp": 42,
     "deleted": 0, "updated_at": 1752340000}
  ]
}
```

`si`/`pc`/`pp` are CrossPoint's spine index / chapter page count / page-in-chapter hints
(nullable — layout dependent).

#### PUT /api/v1/bookmarks/{document}

Batch upsert, max 50 items:

```json
{"items": [
  {"id": "9f86d081884c7d65", "xpath": "...", "percentage": 0.35,
   "summary": "...", "si": 3, "pc": 120, "pp": 42},
  {"id": "deadbeef00112233", "deleted": 1}
]}
```

Response: `{"until": 1752345679, "accepted": 2}`.

### Clippings

Mirrors CrossInk's `Clipping` struct (`src/ClippingStore.h`) 1:1. Item ids are client-derived:
`id = first 16 hex chars of SHA-256(created_at_decimal + text)` — both fields are immutable after
creation.

Item shape:

```json
{
  "id": "c0ffee0011223344",
  "spine": 7,
  "start_page": 12, "end_page": 13, "pages": 40,
  "start_word": 5, "end_word": 22, "words": 30,
  "para": 96,
  "chapter": "Chapter 8",
  "text": "So we beat on, boats against the current...",
  "note": null, "color": null,
  "created_at": 1752300000,
  "deleted": 0, "updated_at": 1752340000
}
```

- `para` optional — omit when the firmware has `paragraphIndex == UINT16_MAX`.
- Page/word fields are layout hints, kept verbatim for CrossInk↔CrossInk restore; `para` + `text`
  are the portable anchors.
- `text` ≤ 2048 bytes (the firmware's export cap), `chapter` ≤ 64 chars, `note` ≤ 4096 bytes.
- `note` and `color` are server-side extensions for future firmware / web UI; send them back
  unchanged if unused.
- No 64-per-book cap server-side (that's a device storage limit).

Endpoints: `GET /api/v1/clippings/{document}?since=&limit=` and
`PUT /api/v1/clippings/{document}` (batch max 50) — identical semantics to bookmarks.

### Reading stats

Model (matches the firmware's nearby P2P stats sync): **each device uploads its own snapshot;
snapshots replace, never accumulate; the server aggregates across devices on read.** Never merge
another device's stats into local ones.

#### PUT /api/v1/stats/global

The device's `GlobalReadingStats` as JSON:

```json
{
  "device_id": "A1B2C3D4", "device": "CrossInk",
  "v": 5,
  "sessions": 312, "seconds": 184300, "pages": 9120, "completed": 14,
  "tod": [1200, 84000, 60100, 39000],
  "dow": [8000, 9000, 7000, 11000, 12000, 60000, 77300],
  "anchor_day": 9650,
  "history_b64": "<base64 of the 92-byte reading-history bitmap>",
  "streak": 21
}
```

- `tod` = seconds in [morning, afternoon, evening, night]; `dow` = Mon..Sun seconds.
- `anchor_day` = days since 2000-01-01 of the bitmap's most recent day; bit N of the bitmap =
  `anchor_day - N` (LSB-first within each byte, 730 days / 92 bytes).
- `streak` = device-reported all-time longest streak (may predate the bitmap window).

Response: `{"until": 1752345678}`.

#### PUT /api/v1/stats/books

Batch (max 20) of per-book `stats_v5` snapshots for one device:

```json
{"device_id": "A1B2C3D4", "items": [
  {"document": "a1b2c3d4e5f60718293a4b5c6d7e8f90", "v": 5,
   "sessions": 9, "seconds": 8400, "pages": 310, "completed": false,
   "avg_fwd": 12, "pace_n": 250, "eta": 5400,
   "start_manual": false, "finish_manual": false,
   "start_date": 1751000000, "finished_date": 0,
   "tod": [0, 3000, 4000, 1400], "dow": [0, 0, 1200, 0, 2000, 3000, 2200]}
]}
```

#### GET /api/v1/stats/summary

Server-side aggregate across all of the user's devices:

- scalars and `tod`/`dow` are summed;
- history bitmaps are **OR-ed after re-anchoring** to the newest `anchor_day` (each device's bits
  shift by its anchor delta; days older than the 730-day window drop);
- `streak` = max(longest run in the combined bitmap, any device-reported streak);
- `current_streak` = run ending at the anchor day (the anchor day itself may be unset — today
  isn't over).

```json
{
  "sessions": 402, "seconds": 190300, "pages": 9500, "completed": 15,
  "tod": [...], "dow": [...],
  "anchor_day": 9650, "history_b64": "...", "streak": 21, "current_streak": 6,
  "devices": [{"device_id": "A1B2C3D4", "device": "CrossInk", "updated_at": 1752345678}]
}
```

#### GET /api/v1/stats/global

Raw per-device snapshots (`{"devices": [{"device_id", "device", "updated_at", "stats": {...}}]}`)
for clients that render per-device numbers like the P2P screen does.

#### GET /api/v1/stats/books/{document}

Per-device rows plus a `combined` object (scalars/buckets summed, `completed` OR-ed, `avg_fwd`
weighted by `pace_n`, `start_date` = earliest non-zero, `finished_date` = latest).

### Documents metadata (optional)

`PUT /api/v1/documents` — `{"items": [{"document": "...", "title": "...", "author": "...",
"filename": "...", "filesize": 812345}]}` (max 50); omitted fields never overwrite stored values.
`GET /api/v1/documents` lists them. Most clients don't need this endpoint — progress-PUT
`metadata` capture populates the same table.

### Connectors (master sync hub)

Pair external services (Hardcover, Readwise, …) to the account; reading activity fans out to them
server-side. See docs/design/sync-hub.md. All under `/api/v1`, same auth headers. Requires the
server to have `TOKEN_ENC_KEY` set (credentials are encrypted at rest) — otherwise these endpoints
report `encryption: "disabled"` and linking returns 403.

#### GET /api/v1/connectors

Lists available connectors and this account's link status.

```json
{
  "encryption": "enabled",
  "connectors": [
    {"id": "hardcover", "name": "Hardcover", "tier": 1, "experimental": false,
     "carries": ["progress", "finished"], "capabilities": {"read": false, "write": true},
     "credential_kind": "token", "linked": true, "status": "ok", "account": "julia",
     "queue": {"pending": 0, "dead": 0}},
    {"id": "readwise", "name": "Readwise", "tier": 1, "experimental": false,
     "carries": ["highlight"], "capabilities": {"read": true, "write": true},
     "credential_kind": "token", "linked": false, "status": null, "account": null}
  ]
}
```

#### PUT /api/v1/connectors/{id}

Link/re-link by validating and storing a credential. Body: `{"credential": { ... }}` — shape is
connector-specific (`{"token": "..."}` for Hardcover and Readwise). The server validates against the
service before storing; returns `400` if rejected. `{"id": "hardcover", "linked": true,
"account": "julia"}` on success.

#### DELETE /api/v1/connectors/{id}

Unlink; wipes the stored credential, all matches, and queued work.

#### GET /api/v1/connectors/{id}/matches

Lists resolved book matches (for a review UI): `{"connector": "hardcover", "matches": [{"document",
"external_id", "confidence", "source": "auto|manual|none", "query_used", "updated_at"}]}`.
The review endpoint (`GET /connectors/{id}/review`) additionally carries `push_note`: a
per-book condition from the last successful push (e.g. Hardcover has no page count for
the book, so progress cannot sync), or null. Cleared automatically when the condition
resolves or the match changes.

#### PUT /api/v1/connectors/{id}/matches/{document}

Manually set a match (sticky — never auto-recomputed). Body `{"external_id": "42"}`, or
`{"external_id": null}` to mark "never sync this document".

#### POST /api/v1/connectors/{id}/rematch/{document}

Force (re)matching now; returns the resolved match or null. Preserves manual overrides.

#### POST /api/v1/connectors/{id}/library/refresh

Force-refresh the connector's server-side library list (Kindle: the purchased-book list;
Send-to-Kindle docs refresh via the extension only). `{"count": 2}`. 400 for connectors
without a refreshable library.

#### POST /api/v1/connectors/{id}/lookup

Verify an externally-supplied book id against the user's account at the service.
Body `{"external_id": "B0…"}`. Kindle: checks the combined library, then an ownership
probe (the converted file only downloads for owned books) — also resolves the
position-space ruler as `book.edition`. `{"found": true, "book": {"externalId",
"title", "author", "edition"}}` or `{"found": false}`. 400 for connectors without lookup.

#### POST /api/v1/connectors/kindle/register/begin · /register/complete

**Self-host only** — mounted only when `KINDLE_SERVER_REGISTRATION=true`. Two-step Amazon device
registration for the Kindle connector (the password transits server memory only; never stored).
`begin` body `{"email", "password"}` → `{"status": "otp_required", "nonce"}` (Amazon emails a code)
or `{"status": "registered", "linked": true}` directly. `complete` body `{"nonce", "code"}` finishes
the OTP round trip and links the account. On any multi-user install use the CrossPoint Kindle
Link browser extension instead — the password never leaves the user's machine. See
docs/design/kindle-sync.md.

**Kindle extension download.** `GET /kindle-link.zip` (public) serves the CrossPoint Kindle Link
browser extension as a zip attachment, for the load-unpacked setup linked from the dashboard's
Kindle connector page.

**Matching** is server-side from the document's title/author (the EPUB metadata the firmware sends —
so connectors need "Send Metadata" on). **Fan-out** is automatic: a progress PUT enqueues a
progress/finished event to write-connectors that carry it; a clippings PUT enqueues highlight events
to highlight-connectors (Readwise). A background worker delivers them with retry/backoff.
**Fan-in** (read connectors: Audiobookshelf, Readwise Reader, BookFusion, Kindle) is pulled on a
background interval for library-wide providers, and on-demand — when a device asks for progress on a
matched book — for per-book providers.
